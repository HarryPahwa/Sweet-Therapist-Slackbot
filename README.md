# Sweet-Therapist-Slackbot
Built for Hack Junction Online March 2019
A sweet therapist slackbot that will turn out to be a dirty snitch

The theraphist lures you by giving you a false sense of security. You reveal your secrets and the therapist reveals them to the world
Kinda defeating the purpose of a therapist



Click here to install the slackbot to your workspace:

<a href="https://slack.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=594637692469.585588823553&scope=bot,commands"><img alt="Add to Slack" height="40" width="139" src="https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack.png" srcset="https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack.png 1x, https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack@2x.png 2x"></a>

or click this link: <a href="https://slack.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=594637692469.585588823553&scope=bot,commands">https://slack.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=594637692469.585588823553&scope=bot,commands</a>


Upon installing, go to a public channel and invite the bot.. for example, type "@Therapist Bot Hello bot"

from then onwards the bot will instruct you to talk to her in private:


The bot uses the following techniques:

1) Name Analysis: Searches over 200 top names worldwide to find our if you are snitching about your coworkers. If so, it directly tells your coworkers.
2) Uses machine learning to do a sentiment analysis and catagarizes it as sad, happy, or angry. Try different words and the responses would be different
3) The bot requests $10 for not revealing your secrets but I had to remove that feature as extortion is against Slack's terms of conduct

Issues faced:

Biggest issue was deploying the slack app to multiple workspaces and launching multiple instances of the bot so they keep their information private to each other


Please ask me if you have any questions
